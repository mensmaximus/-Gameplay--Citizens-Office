# Citizens Office for Anno 1800

## Contribution and credits

Big thanks go to @hier0nimus, @serp,  @jakob all the other nice people from the Anno Mod-Corner International Discord for their patients and valuable input for creating a mod.

## About this mod

This mod adds a modular slot building that allows to socket guild house, town hall, harbor office and lodge items. The Citizens Office follows the logic of a culture building (museum, zoo, botanic garden, palace ...). 

First you build the main building (the Citizens Office). Than you add office modules from the main building. Each module has one slot. You can add up to 250 modules. The modules can be located anywhere on the island an do not have to be connected to the main building.

Each item is influencing the entire islands where the Citizens Office is located. You can change this behavior with IMYA to influence an entire world (session). Items can stack infinitely, e.g. you could have 250 times Feraz mounted :-) 

The Citizens Office has its menu located to the right of the vanilla guild house. 

## Alpha Release Notes

The mod is in development. Do not use it in a savegame! Until the first beta release many things will change and those changes may possibly break backward compatibility.
